A simple arcade-style **Asteroids** game built with Python.

Pilot your spaceship through space, destroy asteroids with your blaster, and survive as long as you can.

## Getting Started

This project uses [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast Python package manager.

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/SweetPeaIN/Asteroids.git
cd Asteroids
```

2. Create a virtual environment and sync dependencies:
```
uv venv
uv sync
```

## Running the Game

Run the game with:
```
uv run main.py
```

This will automatically activate the virtual environment and run the game.

## Controls

- **W** - Move forward
- **A** - Rotate left
- **S** - Move backward
- **D** - Rotate right
- **Spacebar** - Shoot
